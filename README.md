A simple Zakat application to help calculate for your yearly Zakat obligation.

Zakat as translated from Arabic means growth, multiplicity, fertility, cleansing, full of barakah.

Zakat is the 3rd pillar of Islam and is the determined share of wealth prescribed by Allah S.W.T. to be distributed to the 8 categories entitled to receive it. It is an ibadah in terms of wealth. A symbol of Islamic social justice, Zakat cleanses your soul, purifies, and grows your wealth while eradicating poverty.

The 4 conditions of Zakat:
1) The person is a Muslim.
2) The person has full ownership of the wealth.
3) Nisab is reached: Nisab is the market value of 86 grams of gold.
4) The haul is reached: Possession of the assets for one Hijrah year or 355 days.

This application accounts for Zakat on savings, shares, business, gold and insurance.
